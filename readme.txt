WPMobileAppView is inspired by WPapptouch to create custom mobile app view on smaller viewports e.g Tablets, Phones, Watch.

== Description ==

WPMobileAppView has a sole purpose of **separation of concerns** and optimizing the web for users on slower connections like 3G, giving them the flexibility to avoid the complex structure of their desktop templates with lots of images and resources. It focuses on what's needed on the mobile view and it is highly customizable.

Features:

* Customizable Back-End
* You can modify it for your vlog using dailymotion, vimeo, and YouTube videos for posts.
* RSS Feeds.

WPMobileAppview has robust and extensible features for mobile optimization. It sniffs for User Agent and switches to the custom mobile theme from the desktop versions for users with mobile browsers. This version is still on beta and there may be bugs. For plugin support contact me at strich.io
